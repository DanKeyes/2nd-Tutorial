Okay, so first we create a new branch
<br>
Then we click the file name that we want to edit
<br>
Then we click the pencil, and do the editting
<br>
Then we commit
<br> Let's stop here
<br> <br>
Must make SURE that we're always looking at the right branch
<br>
Here we are again
<br> Just like the last time
